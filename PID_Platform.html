                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        <p class="Description">
                        This was a project I did in highschool that I petitioned to do as my final assignment for a javascript coding class.
                        The goal of this device was balance a ball on a platform using PID control loops.

                        <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                            I used a resistive touchscreen for the platform to recieve the location data of the ball and 
                            I used a miniture U-joint with servos and tie rod ends to create the tilting mechanism. I used
                            an Arduino to implement PID control for balancing the ball smoothly. 
                            <br><br>
                            The project was able to successfully balance the ball on the platform for up to 20 seconds. 
                            The materials I chose to use were cost effective but unfortunately they were also poor quality 
                            which limited the performance of the device. The materials chosen caused significant backlash within 
                            the mechanism which prevented the device from fully stabilizing the ball. 
                            <br><br>
                            In the future I hope to re-visit this project with a larger budget for more high quality components.
