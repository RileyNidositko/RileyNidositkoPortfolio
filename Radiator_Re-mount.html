                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        <p class="Description">
                        This project was for the Boston University Terrier Motorsport team, which is BU's Formula Hybrid+Electric SAE team.
                        The goal of this project was to ensure optimal air flow to the cooling system by designing a re-mount and ducting for the cooling system radiator.
                        This project is still in progress.

                        Fusion CAD,
                        Mechanical Design,
                        Project Planning,
                        Welding,

                       <h3>Important Requirements:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                        All cooling components must stay behind the firewall,
                        System must be exhibit a 1.2 FOS for heat out vs heat in,
                        Must not interfere with other systems (tractive lights, GLV box, etc.)
                        System must must allow for 2.016 m^3/s of air to the radiator as per radiator specs.<br>
                        </p>


                        <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                            This project is still in progress. The analysis and designs are finalized
                            so I am now working through the manufacturing step. 

                            The design consists of a main duct along with ramps to focus the air only into the air recieving part of the radiator. 
                            These ramps have already been manufactured so the last step is to make the main duct. This will be done with a 
                            fiberglass layup onto a custom bent sheet metal mold.
                            <br><br>
                            I am helping create a new procedure for our composite layups for all of our aerodynamic pieces 
                            so I have been testing our techniques with other Terrier Motorsport members for verification. 

                            Part of our new layup procedure involves a new tool called a finned composite roller. Terrier Motorsport did not 
                            have any of these tools already and I couldn't wait to order one so I made one myself (see images below).
                            
                            After the new procedure is verified and the problems are fixed we can move on to the final layup.  
                            <br><br>
                            So far through this project I have learned CAD design on Fusion and practiced welding and machining with a waterjet. 
                            I have also learned significantly about composite manufacturing techniques. <br><br>
                            Below is a series of images of the product from the design and manufacturing processes. More details coming soon.
