                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        <p class="Description">
                        This project was for the Boston University Terrier Motorsport team, which is BU's Formula Hybrid+Electric SAE team.
                        The goal of the project was to build a cart which can safely transport and lift the car battery into the chassis 
                        from below while remaining rules compliant.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Skills:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                        Solidworks CAD,
                        Mechanical Design,
                        Project Planning,
                        Welding,
                        Machining
                        </p>
                       <h3>Important Requirements:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                        Must cost less than $400,
                        must be electrically insulated,
                        cart must have a dead man's brake,
                        minimum table height of 12 in. when fully compressed,
                        load Capacity of at least 56 kg with a FOS of 1.5,
                        no wider than 26 in, and
                        brake operation force under 10 lb.<br>
                        </p>


                        <h3>Outcome:</h3>
                        <p class="Description">
                            After lots of different designs and trial and error, all metrics were met and the project was finished in time to be used at competition.
                            The chosen solution was to purchase an existing hydraulic cart that was capable of lifting the battery and 
                            modify it to have a dead man's brake to minimize cost and design time. Through this project I practced CAD design with Solidworks and machining with a manual lathe. I learned how to design around existing components
                            while also improving my MIG welding and project planning skills.<br><br>
                            Below is a series of images of the product from the design and manufacturing processes. More details coming soon.
