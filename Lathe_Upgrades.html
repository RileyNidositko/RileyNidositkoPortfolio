                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        This is a collection of independent projects that I completed in highschool. This includes upgrades and tools I made 
                        for my small lathe.

                        <p class="Description">

                            I made a boring bar and holder for my lathe because I needed one for another project. I used precision-ground rod for the boring bar with 
                            a small piece of HHS inside a square hole as the cutting element which was clamped in place using a screw on the end.  
                            <br><br>
                            I used a hex rod as the boring bar holder for a flat surface to attach the assembly to the tool turret. I drilled a hole for the boring bar fit inside the hex rod and added 
                            set screws on the hex to maintain the orientation of the bar even when removed from the tool post to reduce adjustment time. The boring bar can be rotated within the 
                            hex bar holder which allows for precise orientation of the HSS cutter along the radius of lathe spindle. 
                            <br><br>
                            After finishing, the boring bar functioned correctly. This tool  
                            was not as rigid as a commercially produced one may be, but it was effective at reasonable overhangs.

                            I also made a cutoff bar holder which was also needed for another project. I purchased a cutoff bar and holder
                            but it was too large for my lathe. I heavily modified the holder by milling a thin groove along its length 
                            to hold the cutoff bar. I did this on the lathe by putting an end mill in the lathe chuck and clamping the workpiece 
                            in the tool holder turret. I used shims to adjust the missing axis before cutting .
