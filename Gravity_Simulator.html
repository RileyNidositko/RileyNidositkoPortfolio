                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        This was a project I did in highschool for a javascript coding course. The goal of this program was to simulate the motion of planets
                        under gravity.

                            For this project I was unable to make real classes (due to constraints with the course) so instead I simulated classes by organizing planet objects using
                            an index number across a number of arrays. Because of this approach I was able to continously add new planets by appending new variables
                            to the arrays with no limit other than the proccessing power of the system.
