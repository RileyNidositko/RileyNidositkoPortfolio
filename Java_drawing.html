                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.
                    <br><br>In my off time, you'll find me rock climbing, playing saxophone, and making art. Take a look at my projects and feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more!</div>

                        This was a highschool project the goal of which was to demonstrate the fundementals of calculus through 
                        a visual program.

                        <p class="Description">
                            For this project I created a curve class from scratch by partitioning curves from lines in J-frame. 
                            This was done to illustrate the fundimental principle of integrals. I then created a treadmill of curves which 
                            move across the window with a marker following them. When each curve reaches the end of the screen it is moved to the
                            back again and its attributes are randomized to give the illusion of an infinite random series of curves.
