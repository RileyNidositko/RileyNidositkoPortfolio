                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        <p class="Description">
                        This was an independent project which I did in highschool.
                        The goal of this project was to practice design and manual lathe skills by creating a functional retractable pen out of 
                        a solid brass rod while implementing a special feature.

                            The main portion of this project is completed. The pen is fully functional and retracts using a threads on the end piece. 
                            That being said, when I made this pen I did not have access to the tools I needed to implement its special feature. Now that I have access
                            to Boston University's EPIC workshop, I am finally able to finish this project. 
                            <br><br>
                            The special feature I designed is a built-in drawing compass that is integrated into the pen clip. 
                            The clip is attached to the pen via a shaft collar-like component which can be loosened with 1 screw and moved along the shaft.
                            The clip lever can be loosened to swing using another screw to create the center arm of the compass which can be located close to the pen tip 
                            to create the working compass.
                            I plan to manufacture this component on the milling machines at EPIC.

                            Below is a series of images of the product from the design and manufacturing processes. More details coming soon.
