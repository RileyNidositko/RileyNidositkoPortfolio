                <div id=Profile-bio>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a strong background in hands-on design and collaborative problem-solving. I am interested in sustainable design, mechatronics, and aerodynamics. I also enjoy programming and love working at the intersection of mechanical systems and control software. Ultimately I am passionate about using my design skills to make a positive impact on global challenges.

                        This was a project I completed in highschool. The goal of this project was to learn and practice welding.

                            The go-kart was based off of a kit design which also included some pre-fabricated parts (wheels, steering wheel, etc.).
                            The entire frame was not included in the kit so it had to be cut and welded from stock to the specifications of the kit design. 
                            This project taught me the basics of welding and was great practice for general fabrication and tool operation.
